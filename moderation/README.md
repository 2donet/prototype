Django Moderation System (WIP)

Overview

This Django-based moderation system is currently a work in progress. It is designed to allow users to report content that they suspect violates the law or the platform's Terms and Conditions. Moderators will have tools to review reports, filter and sort them efficiently, and take appropriate action.

Additionally, an automated moderation system will be implemented to temporarily hide content that receives a high number of reports, ensuring swift action on potentially harmful content before a moderator reviews it. A reputation system will be in place to reward constructive participation and discourage misuse of the reporting system.

Features (Planned)

1. User Reporting System

Users can report various types of content (posts, comments, reviews, updates, etc.) for violating rules.

Reports include a reason selection and optional description field.

A UI for tracking personal reports and their status.

2. Moderation Panel

Moderators can filter and sort reports based on:

Severity (number of reports, type of violation)

Time of reporting

Type of content (e.g., comments, updates, etc.)

User reputation of the reporter

Moderators can take the following actions:

Approve/reject reports

Restore hidden content

Issue warnings or bans to users

3. Automated Moderation

If content gets reported by enough users, it will be automatically hidden without requiring immediate moderator intervention.

Hidden content is queued for moderator review.

The threshold for automatic hiding depends on:

The reputation of the user who posted the content

The reputation of the users reporting it

4. Reputation System

Users earn reputation for positive contributions:

Creating content that does not get reported

Making accurate reports (reports that result in content removal)

Users lose reputation for:

Posting content that is removed

Making false reports (reports that moderators reject)

How Reputation Affects Moderation:

Users with higher reputation:

Have a higher threshold for their content to be automatically hidden.

Require fewer co-reporters for their reports to trigger automatic hiding.

Users with lower reputation:

Have a lower threshold for their content to be automatically hidden.

Require more reports from others to trigger automatic hiding.

Installation (Planned)

Once the project is functional, installation instructions will be added here.
